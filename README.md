# WeLabelDataRecorder

A macOS application for recording screen activities and user interactions to create labeled datasets for AI training.

## Features

- Record screen activities including mouse movements, clicks, and keyboard input
- Capture screenshots at regular intervals and on user interaction
- Export recorded sessions in JSON format for further processing
- Extensible design with support for multiple export formats (JSON, COCO, YOLO)

## Requirements

- macOS 11.0 or later
- Xcode 13.0 or later (for development)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Run the build script to create the application:
   ```bash
   chmod +x build_app.sh
   ./build_app.sh
   ```
3. The application will be built at `./WeLabelDataRecorder.app`

## Usage

1. Launch the application
2. Grant necessary permissions for screen recording and accessibility when prompted
3. Click "Start Recording" to begin a recording session
4. Perform the activities you want to record
5. Click "Stop Recording" to end the session
6. Click "Export Last Session" to save the recorded data

## Recent Updates

### Fixed Session Export

Fixed an issue with session export functionality:
- Added proper serialization support for AppKit/CoreGraphics types (NSPoint, CGRect)
- Implemented robust session storage mechanisms with in-memory backup
- Enhanced logging for improved debugging
- Added direct reference to the last session in the view controller

## Architecture

The application is organized into several key components:

- **Recording Manager**: Handles screen recording, event monitoring, and accessibility features
- **Session Manager**: Manages recording sessions, stores interaction data
- **Export Manager**: Handles exporting sessions to various formats
- **User Interaction Models**: Defines data structures for different user interactions

## Roadmap

Our development roadmap includes the following milestones:

1. ‚úÖ **Basic macOS application setup** - Complete
2. ‚úÖ **Screen recording and user action capturing** - Complete
3. ‚úÖ **Data storage system** - Complete

   - ‚è≥ Hierarchy and relationship tracking
   - ‚è≥ Advanced element properties collection
5. üîÑ **Export capabilities for ML training** - Partially Complete
   - ‚úÖ Basic JSON export
   - ‚è≥ COCO format export for computer vision
   - ‚è≥ YOLO format export for object detection
6. ‚è≥ **Web interface integration** - Planned
